Unique1Runtime - at first I was confused about this method due to being not sure if I had to randomize it, I thought that it was similar to part 1, then my group mate told me that this is different and that instead of trying to find out if we are looking for time complexity of sorting a unique array, you are trying to find the time complexity it takes to determine if the array implements into unique 1 contains unique elements

Unique2Runtime - this is the same as part 1, just a different end time and also implement a randomize feature
